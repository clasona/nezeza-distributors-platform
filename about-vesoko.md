# Soko Platform – Quick Business Introduction

**Soko** is a next-generation ecommerce platform designed exclusively for authentic African products. Our mission is to connect African producers and sellers to global markets, starting with the United States, and soon expanding across Canada, Europe, and beyond.

## What Makes Soko Unique?

- **African-Only Product Marketplace:**  
  Soko is dedicated solely to African goods, offering a trusted space to showcase the continent’s finest products.

- **Full Supply Chain Platform:**  
  Soko isn’t just a marketplace—it’s an end-to-end supply chain solution. We empower three core groups:
  - **African Manufacturers/Sellers:** Based in African countries, producing authentic goods.
  - **Global Wholesalers:** Located in the US, Canada, Europe, and other regions, who buy in bulk and distribute locally.
  - **Retailers:** Wholesalers resell to retailer businesses in their markets, who then sell directly to end customers.

## Our Launch Plan

We’re launching Soko in two strategic phases:

**Phase 1: US-Based African Sellers**  
- Initial launch focused on onboarding existing African sellers already operating in the US.
- These sellers will gain access to a nationwide marketplace—no need to import or bring new products from Africa for this phase.
- If you are an African seller with products in the US, you can join Soko now!

**Phase 2: African-Based Manufacturers**  
- Building the infrastructure to support shipping, logistics, and compliance for African manufacturers to export directly to global wholesalers.
- Once ready, we’ll invite African businesses based in Africa to participate and expand their reach.

## How It Works

1. **African Sellers/Manufacturers** (in Africa or US) list their products on Soko.
2. **Wholesalers** (US, Canada, Europe, etc.) purchase from African sellers and distribute to their local retail partners.
3. **Retailers** sell to the final customers in their regions.

**Soko** streamlines every step—onboarding, payments, shipping, compliance, and support.
