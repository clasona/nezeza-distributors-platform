# Store Application Approval System

This document outlines the robust approve/decline store application system implemented for VeSoko marketplace.

## Overview

The system provides a comprehensive workflow for processing store applications, including:
- User account creation for approved applications
- Store creation with proper configuration
- Email notifications for approval/decline
- Password setup flow for approved applicants
- Transaction-based operations for data consistency

## Backend Implementation

### Controllers

#### 1. Admin Store Application Controller (`adminStoreApplicationController.js`)

**Approve Application (`approveStoreApplication`)**
- Uses MongoDB transactions for data consistency
- Validates application status (must be "Pending")
- Checks for existing users/stores with same email
- Creates user account with appropriate roles based on store type
- Creates store with application data
- Links user to store
- Generates password setup token (24-hour expiration)
- Sends approval email with password setup instructions
- Sends admin notification email

**Decline Application (`declineStoreApplication`)**
- Validates decline reason is provided
- Updates application status with reason
- Sends decline email with feedback
- Sends admin notification email

#### 2. Password Setup Controller (`passwordSetupController.js`)

**Setup Password (`setupPassword`)**
- Validates password setup token
- Sets up user password
- Automatically logs in the user
- Clears setup token after successful password creation

**Verify Setup Token (`verifySetupToken`)**
- Validates token without setting password
- Returns user basic information if valid

**Resend Password Setup (`resendPasswordSetup`)**
- Generates new setup token
- Can be extended to resend email

### Email Utilities

#### 1. Store Approval Email Utils (`storeApprovalEmailUtils.js`)

**sendStoreApprovalEmail**
- Professional approval email template
- Includes password setup button
- Store details summary
- Clear next steps instructions
- Security notice about token expiration

**sendStoreDeclineEmail**
- Professional decline email template
- Clear feedback about required changes
- Instructions for resubmission
- Encouraging tone for improvement

**sendAdminNotificationEmail**
- Internal notification for processed applications
- Summary of action taken
- Applicant and store details

### Routes

#### 1. Admin Routes (existing - `/api/v1/admin/store-applications`)
- `PATCH /:id/approve` - Approve application
- `PATCH /:id/decline` - Decline application (requires reason)
- `GET /:id` - Get application details
- `DELETE /:id` - Delete application
- `GET /` - Get all applications with pagination/filtering
- `GET /analytics/overview` - Get analytics data

#### 2. Password Setup Routes (new - `/api/v1/password-setup`)
- `POST /setup` - Set up password for approved applicants
- `GET /verify-token` - Verify password setup token
- `POST /resend` - Resend password setup instructions

### Database Models Integration

**User Model Enhancements:**
- `passwordToken` - Hashed token for password setup
- `passwordTokenExpirationDate` - Token expiration time
- Proper role assignment based on store type

**Store Model Integration:**
- Created from application data
- Linked to user account
- Initially inactive until password setup completion

**StoreApplication Model Updates:**
- `approvedAt` / `declinedAt` timestamps
- `processedBy` admin tracking
- `declineReason` for feedback

## Frontend Implementation

### Utilities

#### 1. Password Setup Utils (`passwordSetup.ts`)
- `setupPassword()` - Complete password setup process
- `verifySetupToken()` - Validate setup tokens
- `resendPasswordSetup()` - Request new setup email

#### 2. Admin Store Application Actions (`storeApplicationActions.ts`)
- `approveStoreApplication()` - Approve applications
- `declineStoreApplication()` - Decline with reason
- `deleteStoreApplication()` - Remove applications
- `getStoreApplicationDetails()` - View application details
- `getAllStoreApplications()` - List with filtering/pagination
- `getStoreApplicationsAnalytics()` - Dashboard analytics

## User Flow

### Approval Flow
1. Admin reviews store application
2. Admin clicks "Approve" button
3. System creates user account and store
4. Approval email sent with password setup link
5. Applicant receives email with setup instructions
6. Applicant clicks setup link and creates password
7. Applicant is automatically logged in to dashboard

### Decline Flow
1. Admin reviews store application
2. Admin clicks "Decline" and provides reason
3. Application status updated with feedback
4. Decline email sent with improvement suggestions
5. Applicant can resubmit after addressing issues

## Email Templates

### Approval Email Features
- ðŸŽ‰ Celebratory tone and congratulations

- Applicant and store details
- Admin who processed the application
- Timestamp of action

## Security Features

### Password Setup Security

### Transaction Safety
- MongoDB transactions for approval process
- Rollback on any step failure
- Atomic user and store creation
- Consistent data state

### Access Control
- Admin permission requirements
- Application status validation
- Duplicate user/store prevention
- Token-based authentication

## Error Handling

### Validation Errors
- Invalid application IDs
- Missing required fields
- Already processed applications
- Expired or invalid tokens
- Duplicate emails

### Transaction Failures
- Database connection issues
- Partial creation failures
- Email sending failures (non-blocking)
- Role assignment problems

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Transaction rollback on failures
- Email retry logic
- Token regeneration capability
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Tests
- Controller methods with mocked dependencies
- Email utility functions
- Token validation logic
- Error handling scenarios

### Integration Tests
- Complete approval/decline workflows
- Email sending functionality
- Database transaction behavior
- API endpoint responses

### End-to-End Tests
- Full user registration flow
- Password setup process
- Email notification delivery
- Admin dashboard interactions

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
- `CLIENT_URL` - Frontend application URL
- `MONGO_URL` - Database connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - Token signing secret
- `SEND_GRID_API_KEY` - Email service API key

### Monitoring
- Application approval/decline rates
