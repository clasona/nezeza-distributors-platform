It features a full ticket management system with real-time messaging, file attachments, email notifications, and administrative controls.

## Recent Improvements

### ✅ Image Attachment Display in Conversations (January 2025)

#### Problem Resolved
- **Image Accessibility in Conversations**: Fixed issue where uploaded images in conversation messages showed as text references instead of viewable previews
- **Missing AttachmentViewer Integration**: Message display was using basic text rendering rather than the proper AttachmentViewer component
- **Poor User Experience**: Users could upload images but couldn't actually see or interact with them in conversation threads

#### Key Improvements
1. **Enhanced Message Attachment Display**
   - Replaced basic text attachment references with full AttachmentViewer component integration
   - Added actual image previews in conversation messages instead of just filenames
   - Implemented click-to-view functionality for full-size image viewing with modal

2. **Interactive Attachment Features**
   - **Image Preview Thumbnails**: Uploaded images now show as clickable thumbnails in messages
   - **Download Functionality**: Added download buttons for all message attachments
   - **File Type Recognition**: Proper icons and handling for different file types (images, PDFs, documents)
   - **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based attachment display that works on all screen sizes

3. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - **Modal Viewer**: Full-screen image viewing with proper scaling and navigation
   - **Attachment Management**: Clear visual indicators for attachment count and types
   - **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when images fail to load
   - **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly attachment interaction on mobile devices

#### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/pages/retailer/support/[[...tab]].tsx` - Updated TicketDetailView message display to use AttachmentViewer component

#### Impact
- ✅ **Conversation Image Display**: Images uploaded in messages now appear as proper previews
- ✅ **Click-to-View**: Users can click on images to view them in full size
- ✅ **Download Access**: All attachments now have functional download buttons
- ✅ **Professional UI**: Consistent attachment display across the platform
- ✅ **Better Engagement**: Users can now properly share and view visual content in support conversations

### ✅ Cloudinary File Attachment System (January 2025): These changes optimized for image upload not pdfs

#### Problem Resolved
- **File Type Detection Issues**: Fixed "INVALID" display for PDFs and JPEGs due to overly simplistic URL regex matching
- **Attachment Data Structure Mismatch**: Resolved backend/frontend data format conflicts preventing proper file storage
- **Cloudinary URL Construction**: Fixed incorrect resource type paths (image/upload vs raw/upload) breaking file viewing

#### Key Improvements
1. **Enhanced File Type Detection**
   - Added `getFileTypeFromUrl()` function with Cloudinary-specific format parameter detection
   - Improved URL parsing for Cloudinary resource type identifiers (`/image/`, `/raw/`, `/video/`)
   - Fallback to file extension detection when Cloudinary indicators are absent

2. **Fixed Attachment Data Flow**
   - **Frontend**: Simplified attachment data to send Cloudinary URLs as string arrays
   - **Backend**: Updated controllers to properly handle URL strings without unnecessary object conversion
   - **Database**: Maintained clean string array storage matching the SupportTicket schema

3. **Cloudinary URL Corrections**
   - **Auto-fixing Resource Types**: PDFs now use `/raw/upload/` instead of `/image/upload/`
   - **File Type Mapping**: Proper resource type assignment based on file extensions
   - **AttachmentViewer Component**: Enhanced with automatic URL correction and file type detection

4. **Robust File Display System**
   - **Image Files**: Direct image display with fallback to file type indicator
   - **Document Files**: Generic file icon with proper file type labeling
   - **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when files fail to load
   - **Multiple Format Support**: JPEGs, PNGs, PDFs, DOCs, etc. all properly recognized

#### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/Support/AttachmentViewer.tsx` - Enhanced file type detection and URL fixing
- `frontend/src/components/Support/SupportCenter/CustomerSupportSubmitTicket.tsx` - Simplified attachment data structure
- `frontend/src/utils/support/addMessageToTicket.ts` - Updated attachment handling for message replies
- `backend/controllers/supportController.js` - Fixed both ticket creation and message addition attachment processing
- `frontend/src/utils/cloudinaryUrlUtils.ts` - New utility for URL corrections and file type detection

#### Testing Verified
- ✅ Ticket creation with multiple file types (PDF, JPEG, PNG, DOC)
- ✅ Message replies with attachments properly saved and displayed
- ✅ Admin and customer views show attachments correctly
- ✅ File download and viewing functionality restored
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing attachments maintained

### ✅ Email System Branding Update (January 2025)

#### Branding Consistency
- **Updated Platform Name**: Changed from "Nezeza" to "Vesoko" across all email templates

2. Check file size limits (10MB)
3. Ensure supported file types
4. Test local upload fallback

#### Permission Denied Errors
**Symptoms**: Users unable to access certain features
**Solutions**:
1. Verify user roles in database
2. Check JWT token expiration
3. Review middleware authentication
4. Validate permission assignments

#### Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms**: API returning 500 errors
**Solutions**:
1. Check MongoDB connection string
2. Verify database server is running
3. Check network connectivity
4. Review database user permissions

### Debug Tools

#### Logging
```javascript
// Enable debug mode
NODE_ENV=development
DEBUG=support:*

// View logs
tail -f logs/support.log
```

#### Database Queries
```javascript
// MongoDB shell commands
db.supporttickets.find({status: "open"}).count()
db.supporttickets.find({priority: "urgent"})
```

#### Email Testing
```bash
# Test email configuration
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/v1/test-email
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Database Indexing
```javascript
// Add indexes for common queries
db.supporttickets.createIndex({userId: 1, status: 1})
db.supporttickets.createIndex({assignedTo: 1, status: 1})
db.supporttickets.createIndex({priority: 1, createdAt: -1})
```

#### File Upload Optimization
1. Use Cloudinary transformations for image optimization
2. Implement progressive file upload
3. Add file compression before upload
4. Cache file metadata

#### Email Performance
1. Use email queuing for bulk notifications
2. Implement retry logic for failed sends
3. Use email templates caching
4. Monitor delivery rates

### Monitoring & Analytics

- Average response time
- Resolution rate
- Customer satisfaction scores
- Admin workload distribution

#### Monitoring Tools
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Database performance monitoring
- Email delivery analytics
- User behavior tracking

### Security Considerations

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data in database
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate all user inputs

#### File Upload Security
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Restrict file types and sizes
- Use CDN for file delivery
